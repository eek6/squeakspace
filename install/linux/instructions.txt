Installation Instructions for Linux (Ubuntu or Debian):

1. Just run sudo install.sh. It will use your package manager to:

  * Install python2.7 if it isn't already there.
  * Install pip if it isn't already there.
  * Use pip to install the needed python libraries.

2. You are set. Click on launch_client.py to start the local webserver and
   open http://localhost:12323 in a web browser.
   

If these instructions didn't work, email me: eek@safe-mail.net. I'll fix them.
