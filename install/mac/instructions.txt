Installation Instructions for Mac:

1. Your Mac likely already has python 2.7 installed, but it might be out of date.
   You need an installation that has pip. Just download the latest version of
   python 2.7 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/

2. Run the file run_after_python_installed.sh. It will install the needed python libraries.

3. You are set. Click on launch_client.py to start the local webserver and
   open http://localhost:12323 in a web browser.
